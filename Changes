Revision history for Perl module Term::Highlight and script hl.


2006/01/16 - Version 1.0 - first functional version.

2006/02/10 - Version 1.1 - generic approach to 16/256 color terminals.

2006/02/13 - Version 1.2 - basic functionality moved to Highlight.pm,
                supports grep option ('-g') with recursive search ('-r'),
                reads from STDIN as well as from file list.

2006/02/15 - Version 1.3 - more sophisticated option reset functionality added.
                Support for binary files added.

2008/12/16 - Version 1.4 - support for HL_INITSTRING environment variable
                which can be used to set common options
                (e.g. default hl color) for all cases.

2008/12/19 - Version 1.5 - distributed as perl package (using Makefile.PL),
                Highlight.pm now uses strict,
                Highlight.pm cleanup from global variable @Patterns
                    (moved to class implementation),
                tagtypes with "xterm" uses "term",
                perl pod sections fixed and significantly extended,
                'hl -help' cleanup.

2010/08/17 - Version 1.6 - bugfix in hl script.
                "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar value" message at exit is
                now fixed.

2010/09/17 - Version 1.7 - in hl added possibility to store highlight snippets
                in file .hlrc in HOME directory.

2011/09/09 - Version 1.7.1 - hl will not put color escape sequences if output
                directed not to STDOUT: this will make it possible to use hl
                safely in pipes.

2015/10/25 - Version 1.8 - fixing multiple errors in hl, including:
                option '-' did not work when global option '-b' was set,
                added global option '-u' to match Unicode characters,
                added global option '--' to explicitly separate global and
                    highlight options.
                Highlight.pm version 1.3 - resetting of bold typeface and
                    background colors could not work.

2016/05/31 - Version 1.8.4 - various fixes related mostly to multiple files
                processing.

2016/06/01 - Version 1.8.5 - much faster start time when recursive grep is not
                needed.

2016/06/05 - Version 1.8.6 - minor bug fixes and docs updates.

2016/06/26 - Version 1.8.7 - added option '-n' to print line numbers,
                file names and line numbers can now be colorized by setting of
                    an environment variable HL_LOCATION.
                Highlight.pm version 1.5 - ignore zero-length matches.

2016/06/27 - Version 1.8.8 - added option '-c' to print context lines around
                matches.

2016/06/28 - Version 1.8.9 - fixes in context lines processing

2016/07/14 - Version 1.9.0 - allow natural Unicode symbols in input patterns
                when option '-u' is set. Support for granular snippet files to
                help hl start faster.

2016/07/21 - Version 1.9.1 - significant speed optimization in the grep mode.
                Highlight.pm version 1.6 - added a new interface function.

                Highlight.pm version 1.8 - minor cleanup.

2018/03/29 - Version 2.0.0 - fixed color tags offsets at ends of lines
                with support for "\r\n" line endings.

2018/03/30 - Version 2.0.1 - do not pass newlines from hl to the module part.

2018/04/01 - Version 2.0.2 - better treatment of the trailing highlight options
                not followed by a pattern.

2018/05/20 - Version 2.0.3 - added new global option '-f' to build the file list
                from the trailing arguments automatically when option '-' is not
                specified, fixed handling of option '0'.

2018/11/13 - Version 2.0.4 - license update, explicitly licensed by the Perl 5
                license.
